### Mapping genetic DNA sequence dataset #s to the sensor metadata
The file `geotraces_conversion_bystation.txt` contains a mapping. 
However, the file is incomplete. We await a complete mapping file.

The "Station" column in the mapping file does match the "Station column" in the GA02_IDP2014_v2_Discrete_Sample_Data.xlsx.  The date-times also match.  So it looks like we have a link!  All we need to do is interpolate for the appropriate depth, if the metadata does not contain the exact depth that we have metadata for.
